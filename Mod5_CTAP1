years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

# With the given numbers of years, we can automatically calculate the number of months this refers to
tot_months = years * 12

# We create variable 'rainfall_cum', and assign it to zero. This will be used within the loops
rainfall_cum = 0

'''
We'll be using 'i' for the outer loop. I set 'i' to 0 just so we don't have to mess with the 'years' variable
But it's worth noting I could have set it to 1, and changed the outer loop to become "i <= years"
'''

i = 0

'''
This is the outer loop. This loop counts what year we're on, and only goes up 1 after the inner loop is complete
Then the inner loop executes again until completion
'''

while i < years:

    '''
    We set 'j' to 1 within the outer loop, because after the inner loop is complete, we want to do the inner loop
    again if necessary
    '''
    # We set 'j' to 1 for readability purposes. But again, we could have set it to 0 if we wanted
    j = 1

    # This is the inner loop. This loop executes 12 times, and will loop again if the outer loop allows
    while j < 13:

        '''
        We put a print on the current year, month for readability purposes. I got lost while debugging, and this 
        helped me figure out where I was within the loop
        '''

        print(f'Year {i + 1}, Month {j}:')

        # We create a third loop to ensure the input is valid. Because if it isn't the program crashes outright
        while True:
            try:
                # We create the variable 'month' and set it to a float
                # This is where the user inputs the rainfall for the month
                month = float(input("Enter rainfall for the current month: "))
                # Since the input is valid, we can break from this 'check' loop
                break
            except ValueError:
                # If someone inputs a letter or anything other than a number, they see this message and try again
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

        # Then we take that month and add it to the rainfall_cum. Which equals itself plus the new input
        rainfall_cum = rainfall_cum + month

        # Once the loop completes thus far, we add one to 'j' and do it again
        j += 1
    # Once all iterations of the inner loop complete, we add 1 to 'i' and do it again if necessary
    i += 1

# Here we calculate the 'avg_rainfall' as we would with anything else, the sum divided by the num of months
avg_rainfall = (rainfall_cum / tot_months)
